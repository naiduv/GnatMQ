# GnatMQ
MQTT Broker for DotNet and WinRT written in C#

Project Description
Project to develop a broker (server) for the MQTT protocol, an M2M Internet-of-Things communication protocol based on .Net Framework. It works on WinRT platforms too (Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1).

MQTT, short for Message Queue Telemetry Transport, is a light weight messaging protocol that enables embedded devices with limited resources to perform asynchronous communication on a constrained network.

Developed by IBM and Eurotech, the MQTT protocol is released as an open standard and being standardized by OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standard), a non-profit consortium that drives the development, convergence and adoption of open standards for the global information society.

In general, the MQTT environment consists of multiple clients and a server, called broker.

This project is created to develop an MQTT broker.  While there are other MQTT broker project, this project is created to provide additional resources to learn and engage in developing useful resources for the MQTT protocol, in conjunction with the M2Mqtt project, a .NET client library for MQTT that supports .NET Framework, .NET Compact Framework and .NET Micro Framework.

The project has an official website here : http://www.m2mqtt.net
